    <p class="section__intro">Trachoma is the world’s leading infectious cause of blindness. It is one of 17 neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) that affect over one billion of the world’s poorest people.

    <p>Trachoma is caused by a contagious bacterial infection of the eye spread from person to person through contact with contaminated hands, cloths, towels and eye-seeking flies. It often begins in early childhood, and is worsened by episodes of reinfection. This causes inflammation and scarring of the inner eyelid. The eyelashes touch and scratch the surface of the eyeball and considering we blink an estimated 19,000 times each day, this repeated action leads to continued pain and irreversible blindness.</p>

    <p>Today, 1.2 million people are blind because of trachoma and some 200 million people are confirmed to live in endemic areas that need interventions. The disease is responsible for an estimated four to five billion US dollars in annual lost productivity - eliminating it will cost around one billion US dollars.</p>

    <p>Whilst impressive progress has been made, we know there is still a long way to go and trachoma cannot be eliminated as a public health problem on its own when it is inextricably linked to so many other health issues such as lack of water, sanitation and hygiene. Trachoma often co-exists with other NTDs; many of which affect the same population groups and demand similar public health approaches.</p>

    <p>The trachoma community is now at a critical juncture to reenergise efforts and build an even broader coalition committed to the elimination of the disease by 2020; Clearly defining the narrative for the next four years – scaling up programmes, strengthening health systems, helping the poorest people to ensure no one is left behind. One thing is for certain – ‘business as usual’ is not going to get us to the targeted elimination date.</p>

    <p>As stakeholders in the Alliance, we know we are on the verge of achieving something significant. ‘Eliminating Trachoma, Accelerating Towards 2020’ is our plan of action – outlining what needs to be done to achieve our common goals.</p>

    <p>If you are new to the world of trachoma, we would like to invite you to join this unique and powerful global health community, which is working hard to consign this disease to history. If you are already invested in our work, we thank you for your continued commitment and look forward to working with you through to 2020 and beyond.</p>
