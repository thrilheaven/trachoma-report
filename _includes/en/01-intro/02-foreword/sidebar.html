    <h3 class="foreword__aside__title">WHO Alliance for the Global Elimination of Trachoma by 2020</h3>

    <p>In 1996, the World Health Organization (WHO) created the Alliance for the Global Elimination of Trachoma by 2020 (GET2020) to mobilise resources and foster cooperation within a worldwide partnership of Member States, nongovernmental organisations and the private sector. The Alliance is the principal platform through which the trachoma community works to deliver WHO’s recommended SAFE strategy – an approach backed by the 1998 World Health Assembly resolution WHA51.11.</p>
