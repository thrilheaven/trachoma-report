    <p>In 1996, the World Health Organization (WHO) created the Alliance for the Global Elimination of Trachoma by 2020 (GET 2020) to mobilise resources and foster cooperation within a worldwide partnership of Member States, nongovernmental organisations and the private sector. The Alliance is the principal platform through which the trachoma community works to deliver WHO’s recommended SAFE strategy – an approach backed by the World Health Assembly resolution WHA51.11 in 1998.</p>
