<p class="section__intro">There&nbsp;are&nbsp;more than 75 million people living in trachoma-endemic areas in Ethiopia, the largest number of any country in the world.<sup>20</sup> The backlog of people who urgently need eyelid surgery to prevent blindness stands at over 693,000 – again, the largest number of any country in the world.<sup>21</sup></p>

<p>The last few years, however, have seen enormous changes in the way Ethiopia is responding to the trachoma challenge. The country is viewed as an inspirational example of what can be achieved with strong country leadership, coordinated partner support, and application of technical resources in order to eliminate trachoma.</p>

<p>In 2012, Ethiopia launched its first Trachoma Action Plan developed in consultation with the WASH sector, NGOs and local and regional governments. Country leaders were aware that trachoma was prevalent in the Amhara region and large-scale programmes were already underway to tackle the disease; however, as the maps below show, the district-level disease burden in huge parts of the rest of the country was unknown.</p>

<p>Later that same year, the country kicked off the Global Trachoma Mapping Project. This unique and ambitious venture revealed that more than 90 per cent of districts in Ethiopia have trachoma at levels demanding a public health solution.</p>

<p>Increased efforts were necessary to tackle the problem and in 2013, the national Trachoma Action Plan was incorporated into the government’s Neglected Tropical Diseases Master Plan. A Task Force was also created to coordinate efforts to tackle all eight of Ethiopia’s priority NTDs. This plan called for a significant expansion of the SAFE strategy and two members of staff dedicated to trachoma were included in the Task Force.</p>

<p>The number of people with access to safe drinking water in Ethiopia has tripled since 1990 and promotion of hygiene and latrine use has been provided nationally through Ethiopia’s 48,000 community based health extension workers.<sup>22</sup></p>

<p>However, an estimated 71 million people are still without access to adequate sanitation and more than 42 million people are without safe drinking water.<sup>23</sup> Without targeted WASH investments, these people and entire communities are at unnecessary risk of blindness from trachoma.</p>
