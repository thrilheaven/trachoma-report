<p class="section__intro">To combat trachoma WHO has endorsed a series of programmatic interventions known as SAFE. These four components form the foundation of the effort to eliminate the disease and must be rolled out together for a trachoma control programme to be successful.</p>

<p>We know that every country’s needs and barriers are unique and not all countries have the necessary health budget to finance trachoma elimination. It is, however, hugely important that national governments own and take the lead to fund, promote, and manage their own elimination plans. For example: generating a national Trachoma Action Plan; tailoring available ‘best practices’ for adoption by the national programme and using training tools/resources derived from field experiences, and the standard equipment list to build capacity and support effective SAFE implementation.</p>

<p>With 144 districts in 16 countries yet to begin implementing community wide distribution of the antibiotics which treat the infection, and 200 million people globally living in areas at risk of trachoma, scale-up of SAFE interventions is critical.</p>

<p>Each endemic country can benefit from sharing their experience with others. There are some common characteristics shared by countries who are at the final miles of their elimination journey:</p>
