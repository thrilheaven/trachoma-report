<p class="section__intro">To combat trachoma WHO has endorsed a series of programmatic interventions known as SAFE. These four components form the foundation of the effort to eliminate the disease and must be rolled out together for a trachoma control programme to be successful.</p>

<p>We know that every country’s needs and barriers are unique and not all countries have the necessary health budget to finance trachoma elimination. It is, however, hugely important that national governments own and take the lead to fund, promote, and manage their own elimination plans. Generating a national Trachoma Action Plan, ensuring ‘best practices’ are endorsed and adopted by country programmes, using available training tools/resources derived from field experiences, and a standard equipment list to build capacity and support effective SAFE implementation.</p>

<p>With 154 districts in 16 countries having more than 1 in 10 children affected, but yet to begin implementing community wide distribution of the antibiotics which treat the active infection, and 200 million people globally living in areas at risk of trachoma, scale-up of SAFE interventions is critical. It won’t be smooth sailing as there are a number of critical barriers to overcome.</p>

<p>Each endemic country can benefit from and sharing their experience with others. There are some common characteristics shared by countries who are at the final miles of their elimination journey:</p>
