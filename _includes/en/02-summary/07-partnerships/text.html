<p>The WHO Alliance for the Global Elimination of Trachoma by 2020, benefits from a diverse partnership of highly committed, multi-sector stakeholders, playing to their unique strengths to coordinate with best effect. In addition to this global collaboration, a number of national and regional groups are coming together to tackle such specific issues as training for eye lid surgery, identifying and addressing cross border challenges and the preparation of joint funding applications.</p> 

<p>The elimination of trachoma relies on an expansion of the Alliance and on success in forming new and innovative partnerships.</p> 

<p>As the GET2020 Alliance, we have the technical skills for S, A; we know that capacity building is not a ‘one size fits all’ approach; we now need to expand the pool of technical talent and encourage new partners to engage with tailored hygiene interventions and investments in water and sanitation infrastructure for for F, E. These partners also need to participate in national trachoma task forces, and regional and global meetings.</p> 

<p>Scaling up programmes, strengthening health systems and helping the poorest people requires the engagement of traditional and non-traditional partners. Effective coordination between sectors brings many benefits. Importantly, it maximises existing resources for shared goals.</p>
