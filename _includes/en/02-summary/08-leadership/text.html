<h3 class="section__subtitle section__subtitle__leadership">Leadership</h3>

<p>Leadership from WHO has significantly increased the visibility of trachoma in recent years. Low and middle-income countries are being encouraged to invest much more in NTD prevention and control, and to collaborate with other organisations and WASH agencies promoting a more cost-effective, comprehensive programme that zeros in on priorities.<p> 

<p>It is important that trachoma endemic countries have access to the most relevant and up-to-date guidance on trachoma elimination and technical support as and when needed, in relevant languages. Achieving elimination requires a wide range of skills and diverse experience. Whole-of-government participation is key.<p>

<p>Pulling together education, health and finance ministries, governments can provide domestic funding, leadership and planning for countrywide programmes and post treatment surveillance - framing appropriate local standards, legislation, progress indicators and monitoring systems to implement the SAFE strategy wherever needed. Effective national leadership requires true ownership and participation.<p>

<p>Sudan and Ethiopia have shown huge progress in trachoma elimination by ensuring targeted messages are reaching children and parents via school health curricula and health worker training packages – In Sudan, a comprehensive public health campaign is helping to drive behavioural change in trachoma-affected regions, and 2,000 teachers have been trained to deliver a trachoma health education programme in every primary and secondary school in the country. <a href="/sites/all/themes/report-2016/PDF/Trachoma_A_women_and_children's_health_issue.pdf">With women up to four times more likely to need eye surgery than men as a result of trachoma</a>, engaging them as ‘change agents’ in Ethiopia is helping to raise awareness of the benefits of face washing and healthy environments – vital components of an integrated strategy for trachoma control that can also support a myriad of other health benefits in poor and marginalised communities.<sup>17</sup><p>
