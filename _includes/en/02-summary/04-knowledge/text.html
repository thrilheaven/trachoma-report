<h3 class="section__subtitle section__subtitle__knowledge">Knowledge and Scale</h3>

<p>Trachoma occurs in some of the most remote parts of the world. Without accurate knowledge of where it is, necessary treatment cannot be given. The Global Trachoma Mapping Project (GTMP), the largest ever survey of an infectious disease undertaken, has provided gold standard quality data on disease distribution allowing partners to set targets and direct resources more strategically to the areas of greatest need. More than 600 teams of intensively trained and certified local graders and recorders trekked to the farthest corners of 29 countries over three years to screen 2.6 million people – on average, one person was examined every 40 seconds. By the end of the project, 1,546 districts had been mapped using the same methodologies, processes and systems, generating over 60 million data items.</p> 

<p>As a result, health ministries are better equipped than ever to rid their communities of trachoma by 2020, leaving a lasting legacy. Understanding the geographic spread of any disease is fundamental for effective NTD control and a first step to identifying opportunities for integration. Although GTMP has ended, the new WHO-led Tropical Data initiative will continue to be a platform for baseline mapping, impact surveys and surveillance surveys for all NTDs, not just trachoma.</p>  

<p>The GTMP data have already been used to support applications for the Pfizer donated antibiotics, plan for surgeries and establish improvements in access to water, sanitation and hygiene. With the huge number of data currently being processed, dozens more applications are expected for Pfizer’s donation programme to complement the S, F and E elements of the SAFE strategy. The last decade has seen a massive scale-up of this programme and Pfizer continues to focus its resources on working with partners to achieve elimination by 2020.</p>
