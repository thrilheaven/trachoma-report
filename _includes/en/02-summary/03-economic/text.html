<h3 class="section__subtitle section__subtitle__economic">The Economic Case</h3>

<p>The elimination of trachoma as a public health problem by 2020 is affordable, cost-effective, and pro-poor.</p>

<p>The disease has a devastating impact on livelihoods limiting access to education and preventing men, women, and children from being able to work and lead fulfilled lives. By leveraging the hundreds of millions of dollars in donated antibiotics and WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) sector investments, quality of life for those living in endemic countries can be significantly improved.</p>

<p>To eliminate trachoma from the world will cost about US$1 billion<sup>12</sup> of which US$200-300 million is already committed - a billion dollars for a disease that causes estimated annual productivity losses of up to US$8 billion.<sup>13</sup></p> 

<p>Investing in the SAFE strategy (Surgery, Antibiotics, Facial Cleanliness and Environmental Improvement) and coordinating with NTDs, will prevent the loss of “<b>4 million Healthy Life Years (HLYs) by 2030</b>”.<sup>14</sup></p> 

<p>For investors, it is a simple and cheap proposition with huge returns on investment. Preserving the sight of an individual with trachomatous trichiasis requires a straightforward operation on the eyelid that costs only US$86, and can be done in the local health centre; programme activities including antibiotic distribution, education, water and sanitation have positive impact far beyond ‘trachoma-specific’ end goals. Some have called trachoma elimination a ‘best buy’ in development.</p>
