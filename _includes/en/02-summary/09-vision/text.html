<p>The potential to eliminate blindness and visual impairment from trachoma is within reach. In November 2012, Oman was validated by WHO as having eliminated trachoma. An additional 6 previously affected countries claim to have eliminated trachoma as a public health problem: China, Gambia, Ghana, Iran, Morocco and Myanmar.<sup>18</sup></p>

<p>These and other countries completing pre-validation surveillance, are expected to prepare their dossiers in line with the validation criteria approved by WHO in June 2016.<sup>19</sup></p>

<p>With less than four years to reach the elimination target, we need to tackle this preventable disease head on. Recent progress resulting from intensive efforts by partners, has given an accurate understanding of where trachoma exists, how to treat it, and at what cost – and we have the antibiotic donations necessary to do so. There is an urgent need to implement SAFE in all endemic countries to reduce the prevalence of active trachoma and TT below elimination thresholds. As of April 2016, 144 districts in 16 countries (with a collective of more than 16 million people at risk) had active trachoma but had not yet started treatment interventions.</p>

<p><b>While the challenges are substantial we are better placed than ever before to meet them – with coordinated action to target priorities, we can eliminate trachoma as a public health problem by 2020.</b></p>
