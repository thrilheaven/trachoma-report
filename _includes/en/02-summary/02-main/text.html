<p class="section__intro">Trachoma affects people living in remote and rural communities, usually in abject poverty; it is one of the most unfair diseases in the world, blinding the people who have the least to start with and making them poorer.</p>

<p>Globally, 200 million people are still at risk of trachoma,<sup>9</sup> children and women being the most affected – with women up to 4 times more likely than men to need eye surgery than men.<sup>10</sup> 1.9 million people are blind or visually impaired, and 3.6 million people need surgery to avoid blindness because of trachoma.</p>

<p>Since 2011<sup>11</sup> we have seen huge progress in efforts to strategically target trachoma elimination: growing partnerships have brought in new people, organisations and resources; comprehensive mapping has given us a fuller picture of global burden of the disease and allowed us to pinpoint exactly where to target programme interventions; public/private partnerships continue to expand to meet the need with pharmaceutical company Pfizer already donating more than 500 million doses of the antibiotic Zithromax<sup>®</sup>; research and field practices have improved the way we tackle the disease; and health economists have calculated how much it is going to cost.</p>

<p>However, while progress has been significant, there remains much work to be done and to effectively tackle trachoma where it still exists, we urgently need:

<ol>
<li>Targeted investments to address the remaining gaps in global progress, some of which must come from domestic budget allocations in endemic countries.</li>
<li>Practical and coordinated engagement from a broader range of technical partners.</li> 
</ol>

<p>To accomplish our goals we are taking a more consolidated approach to tackling NTDs, building a sustainable future, reducing inequality and ultimately ‘leaving no one behind’.</p>

<p>Whilst the examples of success are few and far between, the stage has never been better set to achieve such an ambitious goal. As we accelerate towards our elimination target of 2020, we now have an accurate understanding of where trachoma exists, how to treat it, and at what cost.</p>
