<h3 class="section__subtitle">Leading the way</h3>

<p>Ethiopia launched its ambitious One WASH national programme in 2013 bringing together ministries and development partners to provide universal access to water and sanitation by 2020. Seventy percent of districts in the country targeted for One WASH are also endemic for trachoma.<sup>23</sup> Although this support may not be enough to address each and every community, it does demonstrate what can be accomplished when trachoma is integrated into an overall vision for WASH provision.</p>

<p>Significant financial investment has been given to help eliminate trachoma and to bring SAFE interventions into a broader health and development agenda. In 2014 the Federal Minister of Health announced his ‘Fast Track Initiative’ to clear the then-estimated backlog of more than 792,705 people in need of TT surgery by the end of 2016.<sup>24</sup></p>

<p>The initiative aimed to train 1,117 Integrated Eye Care Workers (IECWs) to perform surgery, train 17,000 health extension workers to identify and refer trichiasis cases, and set up 50 mobile surgical teams.<sup>25</sup></p>

<p>Since the launch of the initiative, 490 IECWs at static sites and 6 mobile teams have begun undertaking trichiasis surgery.<sup>26</sup> Ethiopia is now preparing to implement the initiative nationwide and has committed an additional US$1.7 million of government money for this purpose.<sup>27</sup></p>

<p>Not only has the country concentrated efforts towards the elimination of trachoma, creative efforts to link the disease with other priority programmes have seen Ethiopia reach a huge portion of its at-risk population with antibiotic treatment and measures to reduce the transmission of infection.</p>

<p>Moving forward, the challenge for Ethiopia will be to close the gaps with SAFE coverage in regions including the Somali and the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples’ Regions – and to encourage behaviour change in remote communities through even greater collaboration between sectors.</p>

<p>The country expects to achieve a remarkable 84 percent coverage of endemic districts with surgery and antibiotics in 2016. Due to investments in water and sanitation, and increasing collaboration between the trachoma community and WASH sector, 70 percent of endemic districts in Ethiopia have existing plans for delivering the full SAFE strategy.</p>
