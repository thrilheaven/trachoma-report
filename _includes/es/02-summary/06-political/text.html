<p>For the first time, the United Nations Agenda for Sustainable Development specifically incorporates NTDs into the global development framework (SDG 3.3) – recognising that the control of NTDs is critical to the push to end a vicious cycle of poverty and disease.</p>

<p>As a disease of inequity, eliminating trachoma will go a long way to tackling at least 9 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), ensuring ‘no one is left behind’:</p>

<ul>
<li>The SDGs apply to all countries and NTDs, including trachoma, are uniquely positioned to ensure targeted treatment interventions reach the most marginalised communities and, in so doing, are excellent tracers of progress to leaving no one behind</li>
<li>The SDGs emphasise inclusion of disability and vulnerable populations and have been developed around a universal respect for human rights and dignity<sup>15</sup></li> 
<li>Importantly, the SDG for health (SDG3) articulates a broad vision for a world with equitable and universal access to healthcare and basic social protections (SDG3.8).</li>
</ul>

<p>For sustainable elimination, trachoma programmes will need to be fully integrated into strengthened national health systems focusing capacity development to the grass-root health workers and communities where it is needed most.</p>

<p>Investment in the health workforce of developing countries, as required by target 3.12, is also critical for the scaling-up of all components of the SAFE strategy. More trained health workers are urgently needed to address the backlog of 3.2 million people in need of trichiasis surgery.<sup>16</sup></p>

<p>Recognising the need for urgent and coordinated actions, the trachoma community is committed to supporting the governments of endemic countries to address the necessary programming and partnerships for SAFE, at the scale needed to achieve our common goals and as part of integrated NTD efforts across ministries; and to demonstrating the impact of domestic budget allocations towards these efforts.</p>
